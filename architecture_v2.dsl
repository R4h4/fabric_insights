#  What we are trying accomplish
#  Users can ingest Excel files (local and remote) and connect MySQL and PostgresQL databases
#  Excel files parsing can be configured (sheets, where the table starts, etc.)
#  Data is virtualized into parquet and indexed with Iceberg
#  Relational schema is stored in Ontology service
#  Graph schema is infered and can manually be adjusted, frontend visualization for data discovery
#  Query service allows for query using ontology graph, converts it into SQL and executes against the virtualized data
